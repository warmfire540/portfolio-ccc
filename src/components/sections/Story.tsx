          Curious Cat Consulting was founded in 2025 by Patrick Masters,
          bringing together his extensive experience in software engineering and
          architecture. After years of working in various technical roles across
          different industries, I recognized a common gap: too many software
          projects focus on technology for technology's sake, rather than truly
          solving business problems.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I started Curious Cat Consulting with a simple premise: great software
          begins with curiosityâ€”asking the right questions to truly understand
          the business challenges before diving into code. This curiosity-driven
          approach leads to solutions that not only meet immediate needs but
          anticipate future ones as well.
